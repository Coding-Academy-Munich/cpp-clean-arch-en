// ### The Grand Theatre
//
// 1. **The Game Itself:** Picture the game as a grand theatre where all our
//    adventures take place. It's the overarching world that houses everything -
//    our characters, locations, and the objects that fill them.
//
// 2. **The World:** Within this theatre is a vast tapestry known as the
//    'World'. It's a collection of various interconnected locations. Think of
//    it like the different scenes on our theatre stage, each with its own
//    backdrop, ambiance, and storyline.

// ### Main Protagonists
//
// 1. **Player:** That's you! The one orchestrating the journey, making choices,
//    and steering the direction of the story. You're the one in charge, holding
//    the compass and the map, deciding where to go and whom to interact with.
//
// 2. **Pawn:** In the game, you'll be controlling a character known as the
//    'Pawn'. This is your avatar, your representation within this digital
//    realm. Through the pawn, you'll traverse the world, explore, and encounter
//    numerous adventures.

//
// ### Characters of the Realm
//
// 1. **Non-Player-Characters (NPCs):** As you journey through the game, you'll
//    meet a diverse cast of characters not controlled by you. They're the
//    inhabitants of this world. Whether they're merchants selling mysterious
//    wares, wise old wizards with cryptic advice, or brave warriors challenging
//    you to duels, they're essential to the richness of the narrative.

//
// ### Elements of Mystery & Adventure
//
// 1. **Objects:** Scattered throughout the locations in the world, you'll
//    discover a variety of objects. Some might be simple trinkets; others might
//    hold the key to progressing in your journey or solving intricate puzzles.
//
// 2. **Locations:** These are the diverse scenes or stages in our theatre. From
//    bustling marketplaces to serene forests, treacherous mountain passes to
//    tranquil lakesides, each location offers unique interactions, challenges,
//    and stories.

// %% [markdown]
//
// ### Activities & Actions
//
// 1. **Moving:** One of the core activities involves guiding your pawn through
//    the various locations of the world. Venture forth to explore new terrains
//    or revisit familiar ones in your quest.
//
// 2. **Interacting with Objects:** Curiosity is rewarded. Engaging with objects
//    can provide insights, tools, or even unexpected twists to the journey.
//
// 3. **Conversing with NPCs:** Build alliances, gather information, trade
//    items, or face-off in battles. Your interactions with NPCs will shape your
//    path and the outcome of your adventure.
//
// 4. **Managing the Game:** Beyond the primary actions, there are activities
//    related to the game's management. These could include saving your
//    progress, adjusting settings, or even selecting different modes of
//    gameplay.
